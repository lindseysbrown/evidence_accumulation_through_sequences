# evidence_accumulation_through_sequences

This repository contains models and analysis code for Brown et al. 2023, bioRxiv to reproduce each figure.

# System Requirements
Code has been developed and run on Windows 10. All could can be run on a standard personal computer.
All standard python package dependencies are included in the requirements.txt file.

# Installation Guide
Code for the main and supplementary figures can be installed by cloning this repository and installing the necessary requirements from the requirements.txt file. Code for the spike inference algorithm was previously developed (Jewell et al., 2020), and instructions for download and use can be found: https://github.com/jewellsean/FastLZeroSpikeInference.

# Demo
All scripts may be run independently to produce the desired output figures from correctly formatted input data. Example datasets may be requested from the authors.

# Instructions for Use
Each folder contains the scripts necessary to reproduce each subpanel in the figure. Scripts can be run by replacing necessary input data files.
